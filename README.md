## Data Description:

Data Source: I collected Capital Bikeshare trip data from its official website. 
URL: <https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html>

Data Description: Based on the information provided by the website, the Capital Bikeshare publish downloadable files of Capital Bikeshare trip data. The data includes:

- Duration – Duration of trip
- Start Date – Includes start date and time
- End Date – Includes end date and time
- Start Station – Includes starting station name and number
- End Station – Includes ending station name and number
- Bike Number – Includes ID number of bike used for the trip
- Member Type – Indicates whether user was a "registered" member (Annual Member, 30-Day Member or Day Key Member) or a "casual" rider (Single Trip, 24-Hour Pass, 3-Day Pass or 5-Day Pass)
Note that data is preprocessed to remove any trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any of our “test” stations at our warehouses and any trips lasting less than 60 seconds (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

Data Preprocessing: In order to better prepare the data, I took the followings data manipulations such as handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and dropping unnecessary column such as 'Bike Number' to prepare the data for model training.

Feature Engineering: On top of the data preprocessing, I added extra columns into the dataframe that are: 'time_of_day', 'day_of_week', 'month', 'year' to capture the seasonality and trend of bike ride in terms of time of day, day of week, and monthly in 13years span. 

Data Split: Clarify how the data was split into training and testing sets. Specify the ratio or methodology used for partitioning the data to ensure unbiased evaluation and accurate performance assessment of the machine learning model.

Data Exploration and Visualization: Highlight any data exploration and visualization techniques employed to gain insights into the data distribution, correlations between variables, or trends over time. This could include interactive plots, charts, or statistical summaries to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.

Data Limitations: Discuss any limitations or considerations associated with the data. This may include data quality issues, potential biases, missing information, or any other factors that could impact the model's performance or interpretation of results.

## Deep Learning Model:
For the prediction of the total trip count in the Capital Bike Share bike sharing service dataset, I considered using followings deep learning models with LSTM and took the folowings steps:
Here's an approach using LSTM for predicting the total trip count:

1. Preprocess the Data:
  - Convert categorical variables (such as 'Start station', 'End station', and 'Member type') into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
  - Split the dataset into training and test sets.

2. Build the LSTM Model:
  - Design an LSTM model architecture using frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras.
  - Define the input shape based on the number of features and the sequence length.
  - Add LSTM layers with an appropriate number of units.
  - Add other layers like Dense layers or dropout layers for regularization.
  - Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

3. Train the LSTM Model:
  - Fit the model on the training data.
  - Specify the batch size and the number of epochs for training.
  - Monitor the training progress and adjust the hyperparameters as needed.

4. Evaluate the LSTM Model:
  - Make predictions on the test set.
  - Calculate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance.
